"""OpenAI-compatible HTTP server for Microsoft Copilot.

Start it:

    from server import app
    app()

(`python app.py` in the project root does exactly this.) The server runs on
http://127.0.0.1:8000 — set HOST / PORT to override. It bridges the OpenAI Chat
Completions shape onto :class:`copilot.CopilotClient`; sign in once first with
``python -m copilot login``.

Code is split by concern:

    config.py         constants
    schemas.py        pydantic request models
    prompt.py         OpenAI messages -> per-turn Copilot prompt + session keys
    sessions.py       in-memory conversation_id cache for stateless clients
    openai_format.py  build OpenAI response/chunk shapes
    api.py            FastAPI app, routes, upstream serialization
